# Week 2 

#### Install the John Papa snippets

Download the [Sublime Angular Snippets](https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/Cohort8/raw/master/Projects/Week-02/sublime-angular-snippets.zip) and extract them into the folder appropriate to your laptop OS:

Windows: C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages
Mac:  /Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/JohnPapa/

Once you have them installed, all you need to do is type 'ng' into an existing js file to display the list of available angular snippets, i.e., "ngcontroller", "ngfactory", etc.
