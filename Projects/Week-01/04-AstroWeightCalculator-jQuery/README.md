For this assignment, you've been re-hired by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to update the now virally popular Astro Weight Calculator using jQuery.

## Tasks

1. Create a folder named `dev` to store all of your future projects.
    - For Mac - create a `dev` folder in your Home Directory.
    - For Windows - create a `dev` folder in the top level of your `C:` drive.
2. Create a folder named `AstroWeightCalculator-jQuery` in your `dev` folder.
3. Initialize an empty git repository in `AstroWeightCalculator-jQuery` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
4. Open this folder in your favorite text editor (Ours is Sublime!)
5. Create an `index.html` file and a corresponding `index.js` file.
6. Create a basic HTML page, and make sure it has the following HTML elements.
    - An `input` element for the user to enter their weight.
    - A `select` element for the user to select a planet, populated with `option` elements where the value attribute is set to the surface gravity for that planet, and the content inside of the `option` elements represents the name of that planet.
    - A `button` element for the user to calculate their weight based on the above inputs.
    - A `p` element to display the expected output.
7. Also make sure you reference your `index.js` before the `</body>` tag.
8. Write the following JavaScript in your `index.js` file
    - Create a function that will be called when the user clicks on the `button` element you added to your HTML.
    - This function should grab the values entered by the user from the `input` element and the `select` element.
    - The function should then calculate the weight of the user on the selected planet, and show the weight to the user in the `p` element you added to your HTML.
9. Use Bootstrap to style your html according to one of the available layouts.
10. Reverse the below array of arrays and then populate the select element options _dynamically_ .:
```javascript
var planets = [
  ['Pluto', 0.06],
  ['Neptune', 1.148],
  ['Uranus', 0.917],
  ['Saturn', 1.139],
  ['Jupiter', 2.640],
  ['Mars', 0.3895],
  ['Moon', 0.1655],
  ['Earth', 1],
  ['Venus', 0.9032],
  ['Mercury', 0.377],
  ['Sun', 27.9]
];     
```
## Planet Data 
`

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Planet Name</th>
            <th>Multiple of Earth Gravity</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Sun</td>
            <td>27.9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mercury</td>
            <td>0.377</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Venus</td>
            <td>0.9032</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earth</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Moon</td>
            <td>0.1655</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mars</td>
            <td>0.3895</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jupiter</td>
            <td>2.640</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Saturn</td>
            <td>1.139</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Uranus</td>
            <td>0.917</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Neptune</td>
            <td>1.148</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pluto</td>
            <td>0.06</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>  
</table>

For extra credit, write a function to sort the above data from lowest to highest relative gravity and generate the display using a Bootstrap zebra-stripe table.
