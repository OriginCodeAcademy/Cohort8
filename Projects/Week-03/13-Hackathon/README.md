# Origin Hackathon v8.0

## Due Tuesday @ 11AM

Welcome to the 8th Origin Hackathon!

For the rest of the day, you will be coming up with your own assignment using one or more APIs of your choice!

A great place to find awesome APIs is Mashape.com. You're not restricted to only using APIs from this site, but there are a lot there.

Some other great sources include [PublicAPIs](https://www.publicapis.com/) and [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/).

Some examples of what you could build:

* "DBAA" - A web app that detects whether a given statement is positive or negative using the **Twinword** API.
* "Netflix roulette" - A web app that picks a random movie to watch on Netflix using the **Netflix Roulette** API.
* "Stock Market Scanner" - Finds stocks that are on the up today using the **Yahoo Finance** API.
* "Crime Monitor" - Combine the Google Maps API and the Crime Locator API to show crime in your local area.

Let's see what you can come up with!

## Tasks
**1. Set up your repository**

**2. Create your application using AngularJS**

**3. Write the application**

**4. Follow week 3 coding standards**

## Judgement Criteria
Your hackathon project will be judged by the other cohort based on the following criteria:

- How many APIs were used?
- Functionality
