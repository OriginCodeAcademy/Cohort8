# Astro Weight Calculator

For this assignment, you've been hired by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to create a simple weight calculator that would be used by future astronauts to calculate their weight on the surface of the 9 planets (ok, 8 planets and a dwarf!) as well as the moon and the sun of our solar system.

## Tasks

1. Create a folder named `dev` to store all of your future projects.
    - For Mac - create a `dev` folder in your Home Directory.
    - For Windows - create a `dev` folder in the top level of your `C:` drive.
2. Create a folder named `AstroWeightCalculator` in your `dev` folder.
3. Initialize an empty git repository in `AstroWeightCalculator` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
4. Open this folder in your favorite text editor (Ours is Sublime!)
5. Create an `index.html` file and a corresponding `index.js` file.
6. Create a basic HTML page, and make sure it has the following HTML elements.
    - 
    - An `input` element for the user to enter their weight.
    - A `select` element for the user to select a planet, populated with `option` elements where the value attribute is set to the surface gravity for that planet, and the content inside of the `option` elements represents the name of that planet.
    - A `button` element for the user to calculate their weight based on the above inputs.
    - A `p` element to display the expected output.
7. Also make sure you reference your `index.js` before the `</body>` tag.
8. Write the following JavaScript in your `index.js` file
    - Generate the display title of the Astro Weight Calculator by reversing the string, 'rotaluclaC thgieW ortsA', using JavaScript and binding the result to a span tag using getElementById() syntax.
    - Populate the select element options _dynamically_ using this array of objects:
```javascript
var planets = [
  {planet: 'Sun', gravity: 27.9},
  {planet: 'Mercury', gravity: 0.377},
  {planet: 'Venus', gravity: 0.9032},
  {planet: 'Earth', gravity: 1},
  {planet: 'Moon', gravity: 0.1655},
  {planet: 'Mars', gravity: 0.3895},
  {planet: 'Jupiter', gravity: 2.640},
  {planet: 'Saturn', gravity: 1.139},
  {planet: 'Uranus', gravity: 0.917},
  {planet: 'Neptune', gravity: 1.148},
  {planet: 'Pluto', gravity: 0.06}
];
```
    - Create a function that will be called when the user clicks on the `button` element you added to your HTML.
    - This function should grab the values entered by the user from the `input` element and the `select` element.
    - The function should then calculate the weight of the user on the selected planet, and show the weight to the user in the `p` element you added to your HTML.
