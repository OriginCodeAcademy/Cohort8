# Week 2 

#### The John Papa Angular 1 Style Guide

Review the [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1) for the accepted industry standards on writing clean, extensible Angular code.

#### Install the John Papa snippets

John Papa created snippets that encapsulate his coding standards into the different templates you need to use when building your Angular applications. Download the [Sublime Angular Snippets](https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/Cohort8/raw/master/Projects/Week-02/sublime-angular-snippets.zip) and extract them into the folder appropriate to your laptop OS:

Windows: C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages
Mac:  /Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/JohnPapa/

Once you have them installed, all you need to do is type 'ng' into an existing js file to display the list of available angular snippets, i.e., "ngcontroller", "ngfactory", etc. Once you make a selection, the snippet displays as a wizard that you can then tab through while entering the values that need to be set in each template.
